Each folder may contain a separate README.md file. When working on the code you must look for such README.md files and understand the documentation. If you update the component you must also update the README.md file in that directory or in parent directory if changes in a child directory affects code in the parend directory.

Do not create README.md if it doesn't exist.

Never use any JSDoc comments!

When working on TypeScript code make sure to use `type` instead of `interface` for type definitions.
