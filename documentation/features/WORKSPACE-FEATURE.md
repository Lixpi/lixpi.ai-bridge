# Workspace Feature

A workspace is the primary container where users organize and edit their documents and images. Think of it as an infinite canvas where cards float, can be arranged freely, resized, and edited in place.

## Core Concepts

**Workspace** — A named container owned by a user. Has a canvas state (viewport position, zoom level, and node positions) plus references to documents, AI chat threads, and uploaded files.

**Canvas Node** — A positioned rectangle on the canvas. Can be a document node (with ProseMirror editor), an image node, or an AI chat thread node. Stores position, dimensions, and type-specific data.

**Document** — The actual text content (ProseMirror JSON). Lives separately from its canvas representation so the same document could theoretically appear in multiple workspaces. Documents use `documentType: 'document'` and contain block-level content (paragraphs, headings, lists, etc.).

**AI Chat Thread** — An independent AI conversation canvas node with its own persistence and lifecycle. Stored in the AI-Chat-Threads DynamoDB table. Each thread has its own `AiInteractionService` instance for streaming AI responses. Uses `documentType: 'aiChatThread'` for its ProseMirror editor.

**Image** — An uploaded image file stored in NATS Object Store. Referenced by canvas nodes and automatically deleted when removed from the canvas.

**Viewport** — The current view: x/y offset and zoom level. Persisted so users return to where they left off.

## Data Model

### Workspace (Backend)

```typescript
type Workspace = {
    workspaceId: string
    name: string
    accessType: 'private' | 'shared'
    files: string[]              // Document IDs
    canvasState: CanvasState
    createdAt: number
    updatedAt: number
}
```

### CanvasState

```typescript
type CanvasState = {
    viewport: {
        x: number      // Pan offset X
        y: number      // Pan offset Y
        zoom: number   // 0.1 to 2.0
    }
    nodes: CanvasNode[]
}
```

### CanvasNode

Canvas nodes use a discriminated union based on the `type` field:

```typescript
type CanvasNodeType = 'document' | 'image' | 'aiChatThread'

// Document node - contains a ProseMirror editor
type DocumentCanvasNode = {
    nodeId: string
    type: 'document'
    referenceId: string    // Points to Document.documentId
    position: { x: number; y: number }
    dimensions: { width: number; height: number }
}

// Image node - displays an uploaded image
type ImageCanvasNode = {
    nodeId: string
    type: 'image'
    fileId: string         // Points to file in NATS Object Store
    workspaceId: string    // For deletion context
    src: string            // Full URL for rendering
    aspectRatio: number    // Used for aspect-ratio-locked resize
    position: { x: number; y: number }
    dimensions: { width: number; height: number }
}

// AI Chat Thread node - contains an AI conversation
type AiChatThreadCanvasNode = {
    nodeId: string
    type: 'aiChatThread'
    referenceId: string    // Points to AiChatThread.threadId
    position: { x: number; y: number }
    dimensions: { width: number; height: number }
}

type CanvasNode = DocumentCanvasNode | ImageCanvasNode | AiChatThreadCanvasNode
```

## User Flows

### Opening a Workspace

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Sidebar
    participant Router
    participant WSvc as WorkspaceService
    participant DSvc as DocumentService
    participant Canvas

    User->>Sidebar: Click workspace
    Sidebar->>Router: navigateTo(/workspace/:id)
    Router->>WSvc: getWorkspace()
    WSvc->>WSvc: Fetch via NATS
    WSvc->>workspaceStore: setDataValues()
    Router->>DSvc: getWorkspaceDocuments()
    DSvc->>documentsStore: setDocuments()
    Canvas->>Canvas: render(canvasState, documents)
```

### Creating a Document

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Canvas
    participant DSvc as DocumentService
    participant WSvc as WorkspaceService

    User->>Canvas: Click "+ New Document"
    Canvas->>DSvc: createDocument()
    DSvc->>DSvc: NATS request
    DSvc->>documentsStore: addDocuments()
    DSvc-->>Canvas: Return document
    Canvas->>Canvas: Calculate position
    Canvas->>WSvc: updateCanvasState()
    Canvas->>Canvas: Re-render with new node
```

### Adding an Image

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Svelte as WorkspaceCanvas.svelte
    participant Modal as ImageUploadModal
    participant API as /api/images/:workspaceId
    participant ObjStore as NATS Object Store
    participant WSvc as WorkspaceService

    User->>Svelte: Click "+ Add Image"
    Svelte->>Modal: show()
    User->>Modal: Select/drop image file
    Modal->>API: POST file (multipart)
    API->>ObjStore: putObject(fileId, buffer)
    API-->>Modal: { fileId, url }
    Modal->>Svelte: onComplete({ fileId, src })
    Svelte->>Svelte: Load image to get aspectRatio
    Svelte->>Svelte: Create ImageCanvasNode
    Svelte->>WSvc: updateCanvasState()
    Svelte->>Svelte: Re-render with new image node

Note: after an image is uploaded the client loads it to determine the natural aspect ratio. On load the client verifies that the stored node dimensions match that ratio; if they do not match it corrects the node dimensions and persists the corrected values so stale nodes self-heal. Image resize uses a diagonal-based algorithm for smooth, aspect-locked resizing and the UI computes resize handle size/offsets dynamically so handles remain visually consistent regardless of canvas zoom.
```

### Deleting an Image

When an image node is removed from the canvas (either by user action or programmatically):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Canvas as WorkspaceCanvas.ts
    participant Tracker as canvasImageLifecycle
    participant NATS as NATS Client
    participant API as API Service
    participant ObjStore as NATS Object Store

    User->>Canvas: Remove image node
    Canvas->>Canvas: commitCanvasState(newState)
    Note: committing canvas state persists corrected dimensions and triggers the image lifecycle tracker which will detect removed fileIds and call `deleteImage` to remove orphaned files from storage.
    Canvas->>Tracker: trackCanvasState(newState)
    Tracker->>Tracker: Compare previous vs current
    Tracker->>Tracker: Detect removed image
    Tracker->>NATS: DELETE_IMAGE request
    NATS->>API: Handle deletion
    API->>ObjStore: deleteObject(fileId)
    API->>API: Remove from workspace.files
```

### Editing Content

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ProseMirror
    participant Canvas as WorkspaceCanvas.ts
    participant Svelte as WorkspaceCanvas.svelte
    participant DSvc as DocumentService

    User->>ProseMirror: Type content
    ProseMirror->>Canvas: onEditorChange(content)
    Canvas->>Svelte: onDocumentContentChange()
    Svelte->>DSvc: updateDocument()
    DSvc->>DSvc: NATS request (debounced)
```

### Moving a Document

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Canvas as WorkspaceCanvas.ts
    participant Svelte
    participant Store as workspaceStore
    participant WSvc as WorkspaceService

    User->>Canvas: Mousedown on drag overlay
    Canvas->>Canvas: Disable pan, track mouse
    User->>Canvas: Mousemove
    Canvas->>Canvas: Update node position (DOM)
    User->>Canvas: Mouseup
    Canvas->>Svelte: onCanvasStateChange(newNodes)
    Svelte->>Store: updateCanvasState()
    Svelte->>WSvc: updateCanvasState()
```

## Frontend Stores

```typescript
{
    meta: { loadingStatus },
    data: WorkspaceMeta[]
}
```

### workspaceStore

        name,
        canvasState,
        files,
        ...
    }
}
```

### documentsStore

## Persistence Strategy

Canvas state changes are debounced (1 second) before persisting. This prevents hammering the backend during continuous pan/zoom operations.

Document content changes are handled by `DocumentService.updateDocument()` which has its own debouncing logic.

Position and dimension changes after drag/resize are persisted immediately via `onCanvasStateChange`.

## Image Lifecycle Management

Images on the canvas are tracked by `canvasImageLifecycle.ts`. When an image node is removed from the canvas state:

1. The tracker compares previous and current canvas states
2. Detects which fileIds are no longer present
3. Calls `deleteImage()` from `imageUtils.ts` to delete from storage
4. The same `deleteImage()` utility is shared with ProseMirror's `imageLifecyclePlugin`

This ensures orphaned images don't accumulate in storage.

## Lazy Content Loading

Canvas nodes store dimensions in `canvasState` but content is fetched only when nodes enter the viewport. This optimizes initial workspace load and memory usage for large workspaces.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Initialization
        WS[Workspace Load] --> CS[Fetch canvasState]
        CS --> RN[Render Node Placeholders]
        RN --> |dimensions from canvasState| DOM[Position Empty Shells]
    end

    subgraph Viewport Detection
        PZ[Pan/Zoom Event] --> VIS{isNodeInViewport?}
        VIS -->|Yes, not loaded| FETCH[Fetch Content]
        VIS -->|Yes, already loaded| SKIP[Skip]
        VIS -->|No| SKIP
    end

    subgraph Content Loading
        FETCH --> |document| DSVC[DocumentService.getDocument]
        FETCH --> |aiChatThread| ASVC[AiChatThreadService.getAiChatThread]
        DSVC --> STORE[Update Store]
        ASVC --> STORE
        STORE --> EDITOR[Instantiate ProseMirror]
        EDITOR --> REPLACE[Replace Placeholder with Editor]
    end

    subgraph Error Handling
        FETCH --> |error| ERR[Show Error State]
        ERR --> RETRY[Retry Button]
        RETRY --> FETCH
    end
```

### Content Fetching Strategy

- **No debouncing** — Content is fetched immediately when node enters viewport for responsive UX
- **No unloading** — Once loaded, content remains in memory to avoid re-fetch on pan back
- **Parallel fetching** — Multiple nodes entering viewport simultaneously trigger parallel fetch requests
- **ResizeObserver** — Pane bounds are tracked for accurate visibility detection during window resizes

## AI Interaction Routing

AI chat threads use a workspace-scoped routing pattern for streaming responses:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Editor as AI Chat Thread Editor
    participant AIS as AiInteractionService
    participant NATS as NATS
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant LLM as llm-api (Python)

    Note over AIS: Subscribes to<br/>receiveMessage.{workspaceId}.{threadId}

    Editor->>AIS: sendChatMessage({ messages, aiModel })
    AIS->>NATS: publish(CHAT_SEND_MESSAGE, {<br/>  workspaceId,<br/>  aiChatThreadId,<br/>  messages,<br/>  aiModel<br/>})
    NATS->>API: Route to handler
    API->>API: Validate workspace access
    API->>API: Fetch AI model pricing
    API->>NATS: publish(CHAT_PROCESS, {...})
    NATS->>LLM: Route to Python

    loop Streaming Response
        LLM->>NATS: publish(receiveMessage.{workspaceId}.{threadId}, chunk)
        NATS->>AIS: Deliver to subscriber
        AIS->>Editor: Insert content via SegmentsReceiver
    end
```

Each AI chat thread node has its own `AiInteractionService` instance, enabling concurrent AI streams across multiple threads in the same workspace.

## Persistence Strategy

Canvas state changes are debounced (1 second) before persisting. This prevents hammering the backend during continuous pan/zoom operations.

Document content changes are handled by `DocumentService.updateDocument()` which has its own debouncing logic.

AI chat thread content changes are handled by `AiChatThreadService.updateAiChatThread()` with similar debouncing.

Position and dimension changes after drag/resize are persisted immediately via `onCanvasStateChange`.

## Image Lifecycle Management

Images on the canvas are tracked by `canvasImageLifecycle.ts`. When an image node is removed from the canvas state:

1. The tracker compares previous and current canvas states
2. Detects which fileIds are no longer present
3. Calls `deleteImage()` from `imageUtils.ts` to delete from storage
4. The same `deleteImage()` utility is shared with ProseMirror's `imageLifecyclePlugin`

This ensures orphaned images don't accumulate in storage.
